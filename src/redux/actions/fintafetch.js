You will be responsible for small and large projects, and take them from planning to completion. You will be our first full-time hire for this position, with the option of leading our future UX team.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The way we work</strong></p>\n<p>We are a remote first company. We value your integrity, autonomy and willingness to learn and share as a team above everything else. You can work from anywhere you like (within an American or European time zone). We have a small headquarter office near Berlin but <strong>our team is completely remote</strong> and currently works from Germany, Portugal, Spain and Austria. Your working hours are flexible.</p>\n<p>Authory is a small company — you will have a lot of freedom and a lot of ownership. We are careful to limit any overhead to give you time to focus and build an A+ product, and we are quick in getting what you conceive into the hands of our customers. We are a startup that deliberately didn't go down the venture capital route. Instead, we are fully self-funded and operating profitably.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>The work to be done</strong></p>\n<p>Your work is the <strong>incredibly important link</strong> between the advanced technology platform that is behind Authory and the <strong>pleasantly light-weight experience</strong> that our customers have. What you will do affects thousands of journalists, writers and thought leaders who use Authory every single day.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will get to know our customers, understand their problems and develop an awareness for the way they tick.</li>\n<li>You will be responsible for coming up with solutions for given problem statements, and taking your solutions from planning and prototyping to validating, and then to designing high-fi mockups ready for implementation by our frontend team.</li>\n<li>You will have the opportunity to evaluate our existing Design System in a holistic way and gradually transition to a revised version that is ready for the next chapters of our product development.</li>\n<li>You will help us setup and refine our design process. As a first hire in this position, you can help us do things properly from the start.</li>\n<li>You will work closely with the founders and the frontend developers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>About you</strong></p>\n<p>First and foremost, you are <strong>self-motivated</strong> and <strong>self-directed</strong>. You will have the opportunity to take real ownership of your work and see it through from start to finish, understanding that you are responsible for tackling and clearing any obstacles in the way, with the help of the entire team of course. At Authory, true ownership means that you own the losses just as much as the wins, and both will naturally occur.</p>\n<p>Beyond these fundamental qualities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are a generalist with extensive experience both in UI and UX, and have a deep understanding of usability concepts.</li>\n<li>You are focussed on the \"Why\". You don't just design to make things look pretty, but have a thoughtful approach behind every decision.</li>\n<li>You have 5+ years of experience in web-based application design, including time spent on beautiful and elegant SaaS products, desktop and mobile.</li>\n<li>You have a strong portfolio showing your strengths and your design process.</li>\n<li>You know your way around tools like Figma or Sketch for everything from creating lo-fi sketches and clickable prototypes to high-fi designs.</li>\n<li>You have worked with Design Systems and know how to maintain one.</li>\n<li>You have a good feeling for how branding strategy extends to UI.</li>\n<li>You are in a European or American timezone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Truly meaningful work</strong>: We are not building a generic product for corporate use. Our customers, mainly journalists, are an important part of our society who are in with their hearts, and it shows in the relationships we have.</li>\n<li><strong>Time to design:</strong> As we are a small team, we have fewer meetings/overhead and instead focus on giving you the time and space to build an A+ product.</li>\n<li><strong>Real appreciation</strong>: An outstanding UX is not only a means to an end for us, but has become a major reason of why customers choose Authory in the first place. Hence, we as a company value product design very highly.</li>\n<li>Remote work</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible work hours</strong></li>\n<li>25 days vacation per year</li>\n<li><strong>Generous compensation</strong></li>\n<li>Option to become <strong>leader of future UX team<br></strong></li>\n<li>Choose between working full-time or 4 days a week at 80% compensation</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>About Authory</strong></p>\n<p>Authory is a rapidly growing platform enabling writers, journalists, bloggers and all kinds of thought leaders to take control of their content, build their own audience and advance their career — regardless of where they publish.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2017, we are dedicated to helping writers (and in the future all kinds of content creators) to become more independent and succeed in the challenging environment of online media.</p>\n<p>Our platform is <strong>used by 1,000s of customers every day</strong>, among them journalists for <strong>The New York Times, Washington Post, The Economist, TechCrunch, CNN</strong> and many, many more.</p>\n<p>Learn more about Authory at <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://authory.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">authory.com</a></p>\n"

We are working to provide the main advertising platform of the Open Web making it simple for anyone to run effective campaigns online. We believe this is the only way of preserving and improving the state of the Internet by making it open and fair. We’re targeting a $200B market.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">The problem we’re working on</div>\n<p>As of today, Open Web advertising is a mess with unnecessary complexity, opacity, low respect of user privacy and poor performances for advertisers as well as publishers. This is what allows <strong>Walled Gardens (Google, Facebook, …) to dominate the online advertising market</strong> as they provide simple &amp; efficient advertising platforms. A simple &amp; efficient ad platform is necessary to value the <strong>Open Web, promote free access </strong>to information and fight the duopoly.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\">Our solution and achievements</div>\n<p>Since <strong>2017</strong>, we’ve worked on the hardest part of creating the ad platform of the Open Web. An automated set of tools and technologies to buy advertising in real time while delivering strong performances for advertisers.</p>\n<p>We’ve proved that our approach works with over <strong>200 brands</strong> on more than <strong>1500 campaigns</strong> and managed to consistently beat every advertising platform on the market. This success helped KMTX grow very quickly to an <strong>8 figures revenue</strong>.</p>\n<p>We are now building and deploying a self-served platform that aims to be “<strong>the Facebook Ads of the Open Web</strong>”. It allows advertisers to launch campaigns in less than 5 minutes on any inventory (Web, Apps, TV, ...) and deliver strong results for their brand. <strong>Simple &amp; Efficient</strong>.

To perform at their best, our people should be happy and challenged. We want our people to evolve, learn, and grow in a pleasurable work environment.</p>\n<p>We care a lot about <strong>autonomy and trust</strong> which we lead by example as being very flexible on work hours or on the missions you want to work.

Ambassador Labs is backed by top investors including Insight Partners, Matrix Partners, Trinity Ventures, and Four Rivers Group.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">We are looking to hire colleagues that care as much about empowering developers as we do and have embraced the cloud native phenomenon that is taking over the world. We strongly believe that Ambassador Labs’ success is dependent on hiring a diverse team.

This is a rare opportunity to join a growing team of smart and empathetic software engineers. The role is focused primarily on development of new products and services. </span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">We have loosely adopted Basecamp’s Shape-Up approach to development by undertaking well-shaped projects in six-week cycles. As a team, our focus is firmly on products that help users make the shift to the cloud with Kubernetes, front and center.</span></div>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">A week in this role will look like:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Monday: short-term tactical tasks such as working with Customer Support to determine what needs fixing right away versus what is a feature for the next cycle, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Tuesday: short-term tactical tasks such as working with the GTM team on how to make our products easier to try, adopt, and love</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Wednesday: medium-term tactical such as refining the ‘stories’/specs for the next development cycle</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Thursday: longer-term strategic outreach such as talking to customers and prospects, interacting with the OSS community members, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Friday: longer-term strategic items such as competitive analysis and market research</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">About You</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">You are someone who enjoys the product definition aspect of developing products including finding and analyzing the data to find what is really needed, describing those needs in sufficient clarity for engineers to implement, technical enough to use your and your competitors products, and realistic enough to prioritize what is actually important over what just seems important. At the core, you are motivated by figuring out ways for developers to own their work through the power of microservices and Kubernetes. You’re driven by understanding customers and their problems.

You won’t groom bug backlogs nor sort lists of features by ROI; you will have a deep understanding of the product space (because you’ll have done the research) and you’ll be able to justify why our users will be happier if we allocate our limited resources to this versus that, etc.</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 11pt;\">We're looking for bold and passionate people to be a part of our mission to provide a great cloud native developer experience. We'd love to have you apply, even if you don't feel you meet every single requirement.

Our pods are a way of bridging the gap between being 100% remote and working in an office.

This is our way of creating the best of both worlds. For now, everyone is 100% remote. </span></div>\n"

We use any means necessary to solve a problem; our toolbox includes anything from ugly solutions and dirty hacks, to using new technologies and coming up with innovative ideas.

We work smart, not hard.</li>\n<li><strong>...stick to the vision and listen to the customers:</strong><br>Aigent’s goal is to help agents in real time during voice conversations and we keep this in mind whenever we work on our product and technologies.

Consumers expect realtime digital experiences as standard and synchronized data in realtime is business critical for many organisations. Yet, at the same time, organizations don’t have the in-house capabilities nor the time to do this efficiently at scale. That’s where Ably comes in.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We provide a suite of APIs to build, extend, and deliver powerful digital experiences in realtime for more than 250 million devices across 80 countries each month. Organizations like Toyota, Bloomberg, HubSpot, and Hopin depend on Ably’s platform to offload the growing complexity of business-critical realtime data synchronization at global scale.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>But we can’t rest yet. And we’d like your help.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>What we do</strong></p>\n<p>Ably’s engineering team is deeply technical, collectively bringing a wealth of experience and broad technology skills across infrastructure, security, distributed systems, and much more.

When we have enough of what we need to act, we act.</li>\n<li><strong>Even the best do better.</strong> We want to be the best - but that doesn’t mean we rest when we are. Improvement and growth - true betterment - is an ongoing journey.

Being human matters.</li>\n<li><strong>Dependable people make dependable things.</strong> Dependability is integral to our mission and technology, but being dependable starts with our people. When we care enough to take real ownership of our products and problems - all else will follow.</li>\n<li><strong>Bold creativity leads to the greatest rewards.</strong> When viewed through a different lens, what stands in the way can become the way.

Kactus was born to make that experience fast and simple.</p>\n<p>We are developing and growing a B2B marketplace that connects venue managers to their future customers, through a simple, well-designed search engine and booking experience.</p>\n<p>To facilitate contractualisation and payment, we have developed our own set of tools like quoting and invoicing software, which enables venue managers to completely digitalize their business activity on Kactus.</p>\n<p>Since we launched in 2016, more than 10 000 companies have used our platform. We aim to become the European leader of Corporate Events booking in a few years.</p>\n<p>Financially, we are backed by Idinvest (Blablacar’s fund) and the French BPI and have raised a 3M€ in 2020.</p>\n<p>We are a remote-first company of 25 people, which means you can work from wherever you feel best, as long as you stay in a +2/-2 time range from Paris.

        "description": "<p>You know how no one picks up the phone these days?</p>\n<p>Or when you call someone and the voicemail says, “Don’t leave me a voicemail. Just text me.”</p>\n<p>See, that’s the problem businesses face everyday when trying to reach their leads, customers, and clients.</p>\n<p>They’re stuck doing things the old way (calling, voice-mailing, emailing) and getting old school results.</p>\n<p>The new way to instantly engage with your leads and customers is with text messaging from real local phone numbers.</p>\n<p>That's where Salesmsg comes into the picture...</p>\n<p>At Salesmsg...</p>\n<p><strong>We believe that having conversations is good for business.</strong> The easiest, fastest, and most effective way to create conversations is with SMS text messaging.</p>\n<p>Salesmsg is a two-way text messaging platform that helps businesses send and receive SMS text and MMS picture messages online or on the go.</p>\n<p>We’ve all heard the saying, “it takes a village to raise a child”, but when it comes to your business, “it takes a team to grow and scale” and that's why we need your help.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>// THE POSITION //---------------------------</strong></p>\n<p>We Salesmsg is a fast-growing business texting SaaS product company in search of of a Sr. UX/UI Designer. The Sr. UX/UI Designer is responsible for the user experience design (UXD), usability, interaction, user research, and UI design for Salesmsg B2B products and services.</p>\n<p>You will work closely with the Development, Marketing, Customer Support/Success, and Product Management team to create new features and experiences that support Salesmsg product mission and vision.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>// OUR CORE VALUES //---------------------------</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. We Figure It Out.</strong></p>\n<p>We're a startup. Stuff will break and things will not work as you want them to. You will hit barriers and blocks keeping you from getting done what you said you'd do. You are the type of person that \"come hell or high water\" will figure it out. This is fun for you.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Seek Continuous Improvement.</strong></p>\n<p>We pursue GREATNESS. There’s a wealth of knowledge in books, articles, videos, courses, training events, and everywhere you look. Just Google it. If you can’t “figure it out” yourself, trust me, someone else already has for you. We're resourceful and go deep to learn the best strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Keep it Real &amp; Conversational.</strong></p>\n<p>Seeing things for “how they truly are” gives us power. In fact, we have be real in order to survive and thrive. We have to speak truthfully and honestly because if we don't things go unsaid, animosity stirs, and resentment takes over. It's debilitating for high performance teams to win. Speak truthfully and keep it real. Call it like it is. Provide solutions, not problems.</p>\n<p><strong>4. People First Mindset.</strong></p>\n<p>As we seek to constantly improve we realize that the best answers to many of the opportunities to grow, products to create, and partnerships to solidify come from our customers. Helping the customer achieve success is our ultimate goal and through that we find new ways to make our product and team better.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Be Flexible.</strong></p>\n<p>The road is never straight and there will be twists and turns and bumps and stops. We all need to row in the same direction to work together and get things done. Don't make it harder than it has to be. If it takes a few minutes, hook a brother up. Don't battle. We win together, not apart.Okay, with that out of the way, let’s get into what this role will look like for you…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>// HOW WE WORK //---------------------------</strong></p>\n<p>This is how we do it...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We're a Remote First company with a global team of developers, designers, success, sales, and marketing members from around the world.</li>\n<li>Our team is spread across the USA, Europe, and Asia (Florida, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Utah, California, Bosnia Herzegovina, and Belarus)</li>\n<li>We love planning &amp; executing. So each year we get together for a retreat to work backwards to create our Annual Aim, Quarterly Rocks, Monthly Outcomes, Weekly Goals, and Daily Tasks. (It’s not perfect, but it’s good enough for now. You can help improve this too.)</li>\n<li>Work hard and play hard. Life and work doesn't have to be so hard. The environment we created is fun, relaxed, yet backed up by results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>// THE ROLE // ---------------------------</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create flows, wireframes, and prototypes of varying fidelity that support user needs</li>\n<li>Gather requirements and design, document, and deliver timely UX research findings and designs for a variety of B2B Web and Mobile product workflow scenarios</li>\n<li>Pull from a breadth of expertise in UX methodologies across all phases of the product development process: discovery, research, design, build, iteration, and analysis</li>\n<li>Draw insights from data provided by Web and Mobile analytics and research studies, and turn those insights into tangible design solutions</li>\n<li>Develop and maintain style guides, UI components, and Design System to accelerate development and ensure consistency across Web and Mobile platforms</li>\n<li>Understand technical product capabilities, product strategy, design constraints, B2B business requirements.</li>\n<li>Design and conduct A/B and multivariate tests and optimize the overall web experience to maximize CTR and conversion rates</li>\n<li>Constantly research possibilities and improvements to design next-in-class B2B solutions</li>\n<li>Contribute to team culture by demonstrating a positive attitude, team-oriented approach, leadership qualities, and openness to learning and feedback</li>\n<li>Mentor UX Designers on the team as part of a leadership and coaching role</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>// WHO IS THIS FOR? //---------------------------</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. You Have HIGH Quality Standards</strong></p>\n<p>Quality is everything to you. If it's not pixel perfect, it'll bug you to make it right. If this is you, then you'll work well in here. However, this perfection doesn't stop you from moving fast. You can still break things, yet maintain a high quality of design work as well as output.</p>\n<p><strong>2. You’re Inquisitive.</strong></p>\n<p>You like to figure out how and why things work. In other words, you’re a lover of product and have a burning need to understand the products nuances so you can speak intelligently about it rather than a word bumbler.</p>\n<p><strong>3. You Take Initiative.</strong></p>\n<p>You are the type that finds things that need improvement and you take action. Like I mentioned before, “you’ll be wearing lots of hats” so if you’re the type that's waiting for me or someone else to tell you what to do, please don’t apply.</p>\n<p><strong>4. You Are Goal &amp; Results Oriented.</strong></p>\n<p>Like, you actually set goals and create a plan to achieve them. Not like a new years resolution that feels great for 27 hours then you quit. You set out to produce real results and outcomes that are tied to a big fat hairy audacious goal.</p>\n<p>Aka: You get things done and you love the rush of accomplishment.</p>\n<p><strong>5. You Enjoy Working Remotely.</strong></p>\n<p>To succeed in this position, you’ve been working from home. With COVID and everything happening, you'll need a quiet environment to get focused work done.</p>\n<p><strong>6. You’re Hungry To Grow.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s true. We’re a fast growing company, but if you’re not interesting in growing, then we can’t serve you. In this growth oriented role, you’ll have the opportunity to grow into a larger role to potentially lead a team. We want to help grow as much as you want the company to grow</p>\n<p><strong><em>Still here?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Good.</p>\n<p>So there you have it.</p>\n<p>Are you a match? Do you want a REAL challenge?</p>\n<p>Then, I think you know what to do next.</p>\n<p>- Chris, CEO</p>\n<p>P.S. We don't have all of the answers.</p>\n<p>We're doing the best we can day after day with pure passion to create something meaningful.</p>\n<p>If you're okay with bruises, cuts by a thousand knives, and more good days mixed with bad days as we grow and scale \"as a team\" - then, this might be right for you.</p>\n"

Our users love the Kea API and its ability to integrate with external databases, and they absolutely require excellent performance and high availability. We want a tinkerer who is interested in using their lab skills to support our users. Attention to detail and a methodical approach are essential. You will be working relatively independently on simulating different network scenarios, using a mix of our tools (different DHCP client simulators such as perfdhcp or ISC Forge, performance test lab, etc.), existing open source tools (Gitlab, Github, Jenkins, etc.) and developing new ones.

We have a small team of dedicated support engineers. Not infrequently, our support users have questions or problems that require testing to reproduce the problem or to verify a solution. This testing could result in a solution for the user, or in identification of a specific bug or requirement for development. We are a relatively small team, so we also need to be efficient. We automate most of the tests we develop, to prevent regressions and to scale our test coverage. Most of our automated tests are written in Python. You will need to establish, maintain and monitor on-going functional, system, conformance and performance test systems.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Kea development team contributes to developing the Internet standards for DHCP, and Kea aims to be a reference implementation of the DHCP standards.

We are creating technology to make it simpler for you to connect with your doctor, without having to go into the office.</p>\n<p>eVisit’s product is very popular among healthcare professionals. Usage increased by a factor of 10 in just a few months during 2020, and it’s accelerating. As you can imagine, the team needs to grow!</p>\n<p>I came to eVisit to build the best telemedicine platform on the planet. If you join us in 2021, you can put your hand on the steering wheel with us and leave a big mark on this team and the entire healthcare industry. If you’ve ever wished you could look back at a hugely successful company and say “I was part of that”, this is your chance.</p>\n<p><strong>Where’s the job?</strong></p>\n<p>We are 100% remote, and staying that way.

It’s baked into how we work.</p>\n<p><strong>What's the job?</strong></p>\n<p>We believe engineering managers are the most effective when they are given a clear vision and plenty of autonomy to lead a team of engineers. We have a culture where each engineering manager partners with a product manager and a product designer. You will be responsible for building consensus with product management and design to define the team's roadmap, which consists of building new features, fixing bugs, automating engineering tasks, building internal tools, and more. You will exercise your judgment to determine what needs to be built and when. You will join calls with customers to learn their business, share status updates, and respond to problems.</p>\n<p>We believe one of the most important jobs of an engineering manager is to help your team members grow professionally. You will help grow the careers of your people by mentoring them, guiding them to new opportunities that will challenge them, and recognize them for their achievements.</p>\n<p>You can choose to write code or not, based on how you work best. Engineering managers at eVisit have technical skills. They are able to critically assess technical design decisions, influence architecture, review code, and write code if they wish.</p>\n<p><strong>Our interview process:</strong></p>\n<p>We believe you shouldn’t have to disappear from your current job for an entire day to interview with us. We also believe you shouldn’t have to write code for a live audience, but rather we want you to code on your own time, in your own environment, where you do your best work.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 30-minute info call with our recruiter or VP of engineering</li>\n<li>Three 30-minute, back-to-back, one-on-one interviews with our engineers.</li>\n<li>A take-home coding exercise</li>\n<li>Group session for you to meet the team</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>The most successful engineering managers at eVisit have written code as a software developer and have led a team of at least 4 engineers.

        "description": "<p><strong>What is <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://veed.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VEED.IO</a>?</strong></p>\n<p><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://VEED.IO\" rel=\"nofollow\">VEED.IO</a> is an online video editing platform that makes creative videos easy and accessible to all. Our platform is used by millions of creators around the world who use our products to tell stories, create content, grow audiences and more (hey, you might even know some of them!).</p>\n<p>Since we started VEED in 2018, we have grown much faster than we could have ever imagined. We are now one of the most popular video editing applications in the world. As our user base grows so does our talented team and we would love you to be part of that journey.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>How do we build the product?</strong></p>\n<p>We love talking to our users and think it is the best way to get to know them. This is important because after all, they enjoy using our product and many also pay for it!</p>\n<p>And we enjoy helping them too. About 19 months ago our engineering team was at about 2-3 people and today there are 20 of us. We are still quite small but that doesn't make us any less capable or ambitious. We are hard at work and are constantly trying to push the boundaries of what is possible on the web.</p>\n<p>We love our customers, but we do love our code too. Within the past 18 months we have gone from a rudimentary MVP with no tests to a pretty sophisticated video editing system (...with tests 😇). We take pride in our work and are always on the lookout for more ideas on how to improve it or speed it up and of course keep our users happy. Maybe you have some that we haven't thought of yet, who knows ;)</p>\n<p>As the number of our users grows, we need to make sure that our tech stack stays sharp and improves over time, that we keep coming up with more awesome ideas that keep our customers happy and that our systems can weather any storm.</p>\n<p>We love what we do and we know there are more people out there who can help us and would love it too. And this is exactly why we are always on the lookout for the most talented, creative and exciting teammates to join us!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p>\n<p>Building a video editor that our users love, of course!</p>\n<p>We know that not everyone fits into boxes and we are all always learning. However, here are a few things that we are looking for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strong knowledge of either JavaScript or C++. We believe QA engineers are engineers first.</li>\n<li>Possess an excellent end-to-end understanding of QA processes, organisation, and techniques to drive quality into the product.</li>\n<li>Strong End-to-end testing experience with tools such as Cypress, Puppeteer, or Playwright.</li>\n<li>IaC skills (Terraform / Pulumi / etc.) is not required but is a huge bonus!</li>\n<li>Don't worry if you don't have a shiny university degree or diploma, most of us don't. But, ideally, we would like to see you have a good bit of theoretical knowledge in QA (TDD, BDD, etc), as well as an understanding of common best practices and recent trends.</li>\n<li>Ability to design technical architectures from scratch.</li>\n<li>We care about how we write our code. So we are looking for someone who is comfortable going through code reviews.</li>\n<li>Have a startup-mentality. Be a problem solver.</li>\n<li>Have good communication skills and are a team player who is happy to lend a hand if someone gets stuck as well as can evangelise the importance of QA across our engineering team.</li>\n<li>Someone who can roll up their sleeves and jump on different things. Building a simple online video editor isn’t always so simple (testing especially), so we want someone who is not scared of a challenge.</li>\n<li>Have completed a game of <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.factorio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Factorio</a> at least once on hardest difficulty (joking of course, but it's a great game, you should check it out 🙂 )</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>We are looking for an engineer with strong testing and infrastructure building skills. Someone who loves automation and for whom seeing '404 - Oops, Something went wrong!' or getting angry customer emails are their worst nightmare. We are looking for someone who helps us all get better and be more productive through the use of metrics, someone who keeps our systems healthy and fast. Most importantly we are looking for someone who could help us create a strong culture of quality assurance within VEED.</p>\n<p>Our biggest goal right now is to create a solid product that can move at speed and withstand the pressures of scaling so fast. In order to do that we need to make sure that with every iteration we make, we remain stable and performant. We don't think it's possible to accomplish this with just a group of manual testers or with just automated tests. Ultimately, we want get to a mindset where developers do most of the QA work and most testing is automated, so we need someone that can make developers aware of how they can improve the quality of what they ship by things like writing integrated tests, thinking about edge cases before they start and more. We love candidates with creative ideas! If you have some, please tell us!</p>\n<p>We really believe that best candidates typically don’t think of themselves as just engineers, but rather view themselves as makers. This means not being afraid of working on something you have never done before, have a broad set of skills you are always looking to expand and most importantly you thrive in an environment where there is lots of freedom and original thoughts are welcome and rewarded.</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Our entire team is remote (and always has been). We are happy as long as you’re happy. You will have the freedom and autonomy you need to make decisions and do your best work. Our team is smart, energetic, extremely talented and driven. We don’t take ourselves too seriously, but we all love what we do.</p>\n<p>Work remotely?</p>\n<p>Work from home with your dog?</p>\n<p>Work in a cafe?</p>\n<p>Need a few days off?</p>\n<p>Swap a weekday for a weekend?</p>\n<p>Working a half-day?</p>\n<p>All of the above is 100% good for us!</p>\n"

That’s when you know you’ve hit gold.” - Ha Nguyen</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Appcues is a platform that empowers thousands of SaaS companies to design beautiful in-app experiences that influence their user’s behavior -- without writing any code. Companies like LogMeIn, Segment, Lift, Profitwell, and Amplitude embed Appcues to improve their web product’s UX and grow their business. Now it's time to bring these same capabilities to iOS and Android so non-technical users can enhance their mobile apps with unique experiences that drive adoption and engagement. As a Senior Technical Product Manager, your mission is to define and deliver new visual tools and mobile SDKs that will provide an exceptional developer and user experience.</div>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">About the team</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Product &amp; engineering currently has 30 people organized into five empowered product teams. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Our mobile team has a mission to ensure our customers can design and deliver custom in-app mobile experiences to their Android and iOS users. Today Appcues' experiences are shown to 100s of millions of web users. Since over 50% of our customers have built mobile apps, this team will have a massive impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Each cross-functional team includes a designer, tech lead, engineers, QA, and a seasoned engineering manager. We practice agile development with two-week iterations and incrementally develop, test, and release stories behind feature flags.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">About the role</div>\n<ul>\n<li>You will advance your team’s mission by researching, defining, and prioritizing problems to solve. In written problem briefs, you will focus on the root of the problem, who we are solving it for, and why it is compelling.  </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For any problem brief, you will collaborate with your team’s tech lead and designer to discover solutions and assess the four main risks. Our goal is to find solutions that are simple, lovable, and complete. To ensure success, you’ll define &amp; identify metrics, baselines and measure results over time.  </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>On a typical day, you may meet with customers, write a problem brief, discover a solution, plan a beta program, collaborate on release messaging, share context with other stakeholders, and influence our company strategy.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You will regularly talk to customers without an agenda, and join our CX/ Sales teams, to uncover pain points. You will translate those pain points into insights and hypotheses for how we can improve our product and business.  </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You will partner with your designer/researcher in structured interviews and usability tests to validate problems or proposed solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You will deeply understand the market, competition, emerging trends, and where the business opportunities lie. You know market research is vital to develop differentiated solutions and competitive moats.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You’ll work with our Product Marketing, Sales, and Customer Experience teams to understand their needs and to ensure our customer-facing teams support the product adoption and revenue results we expect. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You will report directly to our VP of product and engineering, <a class=\"postings-link\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbrookins/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chris Brookins</a>.

You actively listen to colleagues and leverage their expertise to understand their concerns and objectives.   </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You seek facts and objective observation and don’t relay personal preferences. You avoid theoretical arguments or battles of opinion and strive to build experiments to prove theories with data. By listening to customers, asking questions, and reviewing metrics, you always try to learn the truth. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You are passionate about partnering with design and engineering to multiply their efforts and impact.  </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You enjoy working at different levels and rolling up your sleeves. You are equally comfortable being in the weeds on a project detail or sharing the context of how a feature fits into the broader market or company vision.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You naturally seek alignment with company and product strategy and ensure consistency and cohesion throughout the product.  </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You are an empathetic and outstanding communicator, both verbally and in writing.

Now comes the moment of truth; you and the team have to defend the results to a (virtual) room filled with executives, you and the team nailed it and showed the full value of using FRISS!

        "description": "<p><strong><u>Position Overview:</u></strong></p>\n<p>Community Solutions' Built for Zero (BfZ) team works with over 100 communities across the US and around the world to build a movement to end homelessness. We seek an experienced, self-motivated project manager to join Built for Zero's Team Excellence, a team dedicated to providing robust project management support to all portfolios within Built for Zero. Specifically, the Project Manager will provide our Data and Learning System/Evaluation portfolios with effective project management, content coordination, and process improvement for our internal data collection efforts, as well as very basic logistics support. </p>\n<p>The candidate of our dreams is organized, but not rigid— a “get sh#&amp; done” kind of person who can work out a plan of action quickly in the face of ambiguity and changing information (this environment offers a lot of both). We're looking for the sort of person who finds problem solving and complex implementation fun and who prides themselves on seeing multiple paths to the same outcome. You should come to work everyday with a desire to serve and assist your teammates as they serve local change agents in communities around the world. You should also see your job as enabling results, not just hitting deadlines or budgetary targets. We have clear strategic plan aims, and project completion does not necessarily equal success if a project does not advance these aims.</p>\n<p>Finally, you should be dedicated and clear-eyed about what it takes to make a difference for some of the most vulnerable people in our societies. This work is hard, and our team is relentlessly committed to rigor, measurement and provable impact. You'll work long and hard like the rest of us, and every day, you'll have the satisfaction of contributing to a meaningful outcome that is owned by our whole team.</p>\n<p><strong><u>About Community Solutions:</u></strong></p>\n<p>Community Solutions is a hardworking team of social problem solvers working to end homelessness and the conditions that create it. We see these challenges as systems design problems, not just resource issues. Our team helps communities use modern problem solving tools, like design thinking and quality improvement, to improve the design, coordination and delivery of lasting, root cause solutions.</p>\n<p>Since 2011, we've helped US communities find homes for more than 175,000 homeless Americans at a taxpayer savings of more than $1.4 billion. Thirteen of those communities have ended either chronic or veteran homelessness outright. We are led by Macarthur Fellow and internationally recognized innovator, Rosanne Haggerty. Our work has been featured on 60 Minutes and recognized by the White House, the United Nations and the Smithsonian.</p>\n<p>Community Solutions seeks leaders at every level: extraordinary, mission oriented people not satisfied with the status quo. We are a team of <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7MqPNX4H63FY045ZjQzSFlKZzQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">values driven</a> problem solvers motivated by results. We eagerly seek and support diverse applicants.

        "description": "<p><strong><em>ABOUT AVANT ARTE</em></strong></p>\n<p>Avant Arte wants to make art radically more accessible for a new generation.</p>\n<p>We started as a cult blog of contemporary artists, initially inspired through rap lyrics and hip-hop album covers. That blog grew organically into the world’s largest and most engaged online art community, with more than 2 million of their followers under the age of 35.<br>We collaborate with iconic contemporary artists like Jenny Holzer, Cai Guo-Qiang, Claire Tabouret and the Chapman brothers, making their work more accessible to younger collectors through sculpture editions, print editions and unique works on paper. And we have built a highly engaged community of next-generation art collectors, which means Avant Arte’s artist launches are heavily oversubscribed, with many behaving more like fashion drops, selling out in under 30 seconds. <br>The company’s vision is to inspire a generation of millions of young people who love art like they love music and who collect works like they build their wardrobe.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><em>OUR CULTURE</em></strong></p>\n<p>We’re a small team with really big ambitions, both for what we want to achieve and also the environment we’re building. We want to create a company that remains thoughtful as we scale and tries to be genuinely progressive in how we operate; we want people to really own what they do and be given the autonomy and freedom to make mistakes, learn, and create something meaningful. We all work incredibly hard because we really care about what Avant Arte is here to do – we’re looking for exceptional people who are proactive, hungry to learn and want to put their pride in our collective achievements.</p>\n<p><strong><em>WHAT WE NEED</em></strong></p>\n<p>We are looking to add an experienced hands-on Technical Lead to join one of our rapidly growing cross-functional product teams.Being a Lead Software Engineer at Avant Arte means you are ultimately responsible for driving complex technical projects from design to delivery. To do that, you will need to manage a capable team of software engineers and help them with their daily work. We believe you should <em>lead by example so we expect </em>a large proportion of your time to be hands-on crafting software. Working directly under the Head of Technology you will have a key role in helping to shape the technical roadmap of the business.</p>\n<p>This is a role that will be challenging and rewarding in equal measure while providing high levels of autonomy during an incredibly exciting phase of growth. We’re looking for someone with a strong development background and a proven track record driving teams to succeed. You will be someone who can lean on past experiences to help solve complex problems, while always being open to new approaches and technologies.</p>\n<p>As an early-stage business, your work will include many opportunities to be part of conversations about more than just technology – including design, data science and product strategy – but the core of your role will involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overseeing a cross-functional engineering team to deliver great software for our customers. </li>\n<li>Mentor and coach team members to grow an unstoppable team and build awesome, innovative products</li>\n<li>Influence and lead teams, encourage the best engineering practices in accordance with architecture standards and best practice</li>\n<li>Work closely with Product Management to deconstruct problem statements into technical solutions that the team can understand.</li>\n<li>Provide technical and engineering coaching to the engineers in the team, participate in their career development as well as actively participate in and help to drive engineering recruitment.</li>\n<li>Contributing to the definition of the product roadmap, helping to define requirements and come up with creative solutions to business problems.</li>\n<li>Taking responsibility for supporting your changes through the development lifecycle all the way through to production.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>The skills and experience we’re looking for are:</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are experienced in leading, coaching and mentoring high-performance engineering teams.</li>\n<li>You have In-depth knowledge of engineering practices and architecture/design.</li>\n<li>You can demonstrate strong leadership skills with a track record of mentoring team members to take their careers to the next level.</li>\n<li>You have previous experience working in cutting-edge technology environments and have a demonstrable track record of delivering scalable, robust applications.</li>\n<li>You are just as comfortable in front end frameworks like react and node as you are in complex data modelling.</li>\n<li>You know how to build scalable web apps and how to run them on cloud computing platforms like AWS</li>\n<li>You will have built a good amount of your experience as a full stack developer and you will be comfortable using multiple programming languages.</li>\n<li>You're a highly motivated self-starter with strong organisational, communication and planning skills, all of which is especially important at a startup of our size.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>BENEFITS</em></strong></p>\n<p>We’re obviously biased but we think Avant Arte is a really exciting prospect for people who want to learn fast in a high quality environment, who are excited about helping make art as popular as music or widely collected as fashion, and who care about building something big in an area of culture with huge potential for meaningful impact. Here are some of the main benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You’ll get to be part of building one of the fastest growing tech companies in culture, backed by early investors in companies like Skype, Farfetch, Glossier &amp; Facebook </li>\n<li>We offer competitive salary, equity &amp; holiday allowance, as well as flexible working hours </li>\n<li>We have offices in both London and Amsterdam and are fully supportive of remote working</li>\n<li>We have a learning &amp; development budget for every person at the company</li>\n</ul>\n"

International candidates are also welcome to apply.</strong></p>\n<p>Current openings are for Junior- to Mid-level DevOps Engineers. Starting annual salary range is $50,000-85,000 USD depending on your experience level. This is a great opportunity for a technical support engineer to move into an operations and developer role.</p>\n<p><strong>DevOps at Pagely</strong> builds and maintains the infrastructure powering our Managed WordPress Hosting Platform. By providing coverage across 3 shifts, our international team of DevOps Engineers helps our customers sleep more soundly knowing their sites are in good hands. Using many of the available services on <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>, languages such as <strong>PHP, Lua, and Python, </strong>and tools like<strong> Ansible </strong>and<strong> Terraform</strong>, we're always working to improve an already-great platform that many global brands and companies consider to be the only viable home for their mission-critical web properties.</p>\n<p>Being a DevOps Engineer at Pagely is not just a glorified sysadmin gig. We empower each member of the team to take on recurring problems and solve them instead of settling for the status quo. Responsibilities rotate between handling incoming alerts, fielding the more complex support tickets for our clients, and working on various projects to improve efficiency, monitoring, performance, and features.</p>\n<p>The ideal candidate is someone who feels at home in an SSH terminal or with an API, but also enjoys interacting directly with customers via our online helpdesk and over Slack. Contributing to and refining our documentation is a routine part of our processes. As a remote team, we are brought together by tools and automation that help us all collaborate asynchronously.</p>\n<p>Naturally, working with <strong>WordPress</strong> is a major part of the job, but there are many underlying technologies and supporting systems you'll gain experience with as part of your day-to-day work. Experience with <strong>Ubuntu Linux, Laravel, NGINX, PHP-FPM, Docker, Redis, MySQL, Apache, ElasticSearch, Jenkins, InfluxDB</strong> — just to name a few — will give you an advantage in getting up to speed. But, we're a team with diverse talents. If you aren't super familiar with everything listed here, that's okay too.</p>\n<p><strong>Our goal at Pagely is to be an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone. The merit of your work and the content of your character win the day. #EEO</strong></p>\n"

It's our mission to democratize AR &amp; MR.</p>\n<p>During our decade in the industry, our Creative Studio team has built over a thousand AR experiences in partnership with some of the world's biggest brands. Our team has been pioneers in showcasing how AR technology can transform packaging, illuminate events and elevate marketing campaigns with innovative, engaging content.</p>\n<p>Our Augmented reality development toolkit, ZapWorks, puts the power of AR in the hands of designers and developers. Targeting a wide range of business customers, from Learning &amp; Development teams at Fortune 500 companies, to some of the most innovative AR creative agencies across the world, our platform and suite of creative tools enables customers of all levels of technical and design abilities to push the boundaries of interactive creativity. </p>\n<p>We are also the proud creators of ZapBox, the first affordable, mixed reality kit that allows developers and businesses to reimagine how they design, build and create 3D experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p>\n<p>To help us to continue to deliver on our mission of democratising augmented reality, we are scaling up our technology team, enabling us to continue to develop our products, build new ones, and increase the amount and quality of work that we produce. </p>\n<p>Over the past few years our team has been working on a number of successful product initiatives, from the game-changing transition from native apps to WebAR, the launch of our Universal AR SDKs, our ‘ZapWorks for Enterprise' offering and many more features and improvements in between. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Our product set includes: </em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ZapWorks creative tools: ZapWorks Studio and ZapWorks Designer,</li>\n<li>The Universal AR SDKs: ThreeJs, Unity, ReactThreeJS, A-Frame,  </li>\n<li>Our websites: Zappar.com, zap.works, ZapBox, and Documentation, </li>\n<li>The ZapWorks CMS and features we expose (Analytics, SAML SSO etc)</li>\n<li>Distribution / Publishing products (WebAR and Native apps)   </li>\n<li>And lots more! </li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a Product Manager, you will be responsible for one of our newly formed squads working across the products listed above, reporting to our Head of Product. Day to day, you will be working closely with a cross functional team of designers, engineers and analysts to achieve outcomes that help our customers meet their goals with the ZapWorks toolkit. </p>\n<p>More broadly, you will work closely with a product leadership team to determine which business objectives your squad will work on, and will be accountable for a set of metrics that help us achieve our ambitious goals.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Skills we are looking for: </strong></p>\n<p>We are looking for someone to join the team that is smart, inquisitive, ambitious, collaborative and humble. The right person will have a desire to help Zappar build upon the great work that has gone before, whilst contributing a fresh perspective based on their previous professional experience. </p>\n<p>You will be a positive influence across the business, demonstrating your ability to get stuff done within the organisation. You are also a strategic thinker with the confidence in your own abilities (and research) to pursue the outcome you believe is right.</p>\n<p>Some of the attributes we would like you to be able to demonstrate in your application are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product sense. An appreciation for good products, particularly digital products and service design, and an understanding of why things work the way that they do. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Communication skills. You are able to communicate effectively across all levels of the organisation. This could be training sales to understand a new feature that you have built, or being upfront with senior stakeholders to let them know their desired project is not going to be delivered this quarter.  </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Commercial understanding. The role of the product team is to build software that adds value for customers, which in turn leads to revenue for the company. You should be able to make prioritisation decisions based on what is most likely to increase sales over the long term. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Data-informed decision making. You will know how to use data to help you come to a conclusion, rather than using data to justify your existing opinion. This could be through quantitative data analysis, or qualitative through speaking to customers / user research. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Problem solving. You are someone that enjoys solving complex problems. You are comfortable dealing with different stages of ambiguity to arrive at the best answer. There is no blueprint for what we are trying to achieve, so your role is to help write one. </li>\n<li>Leadership. As a product manager you are going to be working with a team of various specialists to achieve a common goal. As the generalist in the group, you must work to inspire confidence that you are the right person to lead them. </li>\n<li>Project management. While we value outcomes over outputs at Zappar, we understand that shipping features on time requires effective project management skills. You can demonstrate your ability to take ownership, make the tough decisions on what is built and what is not, and deliver what you say you will. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Nice to have: </strong></p>\n<p>We understand that product managers come from various backgrounds, and that diversity of thought and experience is what makes them so important in adding value to the software development process. That said, Zappar is an augmented reality company, so there are a few attributes that would be good for you to highlight in your CV/cover letter if applicable.</p>\n<p>You won't be penalised for not having experience in these so don't let them put you off applying. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Augmented Reality / 3D design. The products we create enable our customers to build AR experience for the web and native apps. If you have any background working with either AR/VR products and engines or 3D models then that will give you a head start in empathising with our customer's needs. You might also simply be passionate about immersive technology. </li>\n<li>Software engineering. A good amount of your time will be working with our talented software engineering team. If you have a background in programming then we believe that will be helpful for your communication with them. You won't be expected to do any coding yourself though.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br>Other than the exciting work, any other pluses to working at Zappar?</strong></p>\n<p>While our Zappar family has got a lovely (dog-friendly!) office in beautiful, leafy Chiswick complete with shower facilities, bike storage and surrounded by some amazing shops, restaurants and pubs, we run a ‘work where you work best' policy (UK only) so you can work remotely if you wish. We operate flexible start and finish times to make life a bit easier for anyone who wants to spend time with their children, join an exercise class etc.</p>\n<p>For those in the office, we have Friday drinks, weekly all-hands meetings and we have a quarterly town hall where we all get together for updates on the company performance. Our socials have included tours of the Sipsmith's distillery and a team scavenger hunt across London.</p>\n<p>We are committed to making a difference not only in democratising AR but also being at the forefront of businesses in our sector taking our role in sustainability seriously which is why we are proud to partner with The Eden Reforestation Project and commit $0.10c for every ZapWorks plan and ZapBox purchase along with 2% of our AWS serving and hosting fee on a quarterly basis to plant trees and help people out of poverty through sustainable job security.</p>\n<p>We truly are at the cutting edge of AR and have been recognized as one of Fast Company's ‘World's Most Innovative Companies'.</p>\n<p>We actively encourage underrepresented applicants: if you need any assistance or additional information with applying, please contact Shaun McInally-Buckley (Head of People).</p>\n"

Agile development has become mainstream; on a global scale, 92% of developer teams adopt agile development, 71% of which aim to release at least once a week. With such a rapid cycle, manual verification is too time-consuming, and there is an urgent need for automation. Our services can solve these critical challenges and make our clients a competitive advantage in software development. QA’s global budget is said to reach over $1 trillion. We are rapidly expanding our service reach internationally to win this vast global market.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong style=\"font-size: 24px;\">| About Us</strong></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Autify, Inc. is a start-up company founded in San Francisco by a team of engineers who were the first Japanese team to graduate from the top US accelerator Alchemist Accelerator.</div>\n<div>With the mission to increase creativity with the power of tech, we develop and provide Autify, an AI-based software test automation platform.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Since its official launch in October 2019, over 300 companies have implemented <em>Autify for Web</em>, a test automation platform for web applications. The product is steadily growing, and we have provided basic functions expected in a test automation platform.

However, we cannot cope with rapid changes in the market if we were to stick with the old way of testing, where critical issues are only found at the quality assurance stage. On the other hand, prioritizing speed at the expense of quality will make product delivery unsustainable in the long run. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>So far, our development engineers have maintained quality by using Autify or other tools when adding features or when issues occur. However, as the service has grown, we have reached a phase where we must elevate the quality of our software test automation platform to the next level.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div> To achieve faster release cycles and high quality, we are looking for a Quality Assurance professional who will constantly scrutinize what an ideal QA looks like and establish Autify's position as an industry leader.</div>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<div class=\"h3\">Responsibilities</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Design, promote and improve QA processes to maintain high quality without slowing down development.

In practical terms this means the role is about contributing to cross-functional teams with knowledge about a multitude of areas such as: customer and user needs, sales insights, marketing needs, customer success requirements, or even finance or legal considerations.</p>\n<p>As Unmade is still a growing company with an emerging product, this role is also about being opportunistic, entrepreneurial and highly collaborative within the organization.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\"><strong><u>Key responsibilities</u></strong></div>\n<p>In the next 12 months, your key responsibilities will cover the following key areas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lead and empower a cross-functional team to do its best work.</li>\n<li>Enable key rituals such as planning, stand ups and retrospectives.</li>\n<li>Continuously help everyone by breaking down complex problem spaces into manageable, actionable missions and milestones.</li>\n<li>Communicate internally and externally to identify customer insights, develop plans, share progress and create documentation to help others understand the product.</li>\n<li>Straddle the balance of desirability, feasibility and viability, weighing off short-term gains and long-term impact.</li>\n<li>Maintain an awareness of wider business initiatives and other team's missions and milestones to enable, unblock teams and identify product synergies and opportunities.</li>\n<li>Work closely with the Head of Product &amp; Design to align on the high-level product vision and roadmap.</li>\n<li>Identify and seize product growth opportunities and be part of the conversation informing the strategy of Unmade.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h4\"><strong><u>What we're looking for</u></strong></div>\n<p>To be successful in this role, you will need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience in working on web-based technical software products from kick-off to shipping, as either a product manager, product designer, engineer, data analyst, data scientist, or user researcher.</li>\n<li>A passion for getting immersed in multiple, diverse user needs. For example, today our product touches: Sports and apparel brands as a whole, teamwear sales reps, e-commerce web developers, apparel manufacturers, end-consumers and more.</li>\n<li>Experience leading initiatives that require collaboration across multiple teams and stakeholders.</li>\n<li>An ability to stay agile and pragmatic, like being comfortable with changing focus when it makes sense or calling something “good enough” for the job.</li>\n<li>An understanding of web based software, including practices such as continuous integration and concepts such as APIs and services based systems architecture.</li>\n<li>Strong written and verbal communication skills with a talent for precise articulations of customer problems.</li>\n<li>Business acumen and an entrepreneurial spirit.</li>\n<li>Knowledge of at least one of the following areas: Enterprise SaaS, fashion industry, sportswear industry, ecommerce, ERP, digital design tools, visualisation technologies, automated manufacturing.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h4\"><strong><u>Dates, salary, location</u></strong></div>\n<p><strong>Start date:</strong> As soon as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Salary range:</strong> £50k - 63k, depending on experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Our office is based in London and the role is open to UK &amp; Ireland residents only. During this pandemic, the Unmade team is working fully remotely, and we'll make sure you've got everything you need to work from home comfortably. Based on the recent change in government guidelines, we have started to offer the option to return to work on-site in a limited capacity in our Clerkenwell office, but this is optional and many staff continue to work remotely. </p>\n<p>After further relaxation in restrictions, we will continue to be flexible between remote and on-site work with occasional planned days in the office as required. Our future philosophy is a hybrid approach, mixing the best of remote work with the benefits of a co-located team.</p>\n<p>This role may require occasional international travel, subject to covid-restrictions being lifted and it being safe to do so.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\"><strong><u>The application and interview process</u></strong></div>\n<p>We want to hire the best people, regardless of their background. It's also really important to us that we hire in a way which is both effective and aligns with our values. For those reasons, Unmade's hiring process is completely CV-less. </p>\n<p>Instead, we ask all applicants to answer three simple questions which are based on real scenarios that you would be likely to face in the role. Your answers are then separated from your name and double-marked blind by the hiring team.</p>\n<p>The benefits of hiring in this way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It reduces any unconscious biases we may have, like affinity bias or the halo effect.</li>\n<li>We are able to focus on your skills, instead of trying to connect the dots between your cover letter and CV and the requirements of the role.</li>\n<li>It is proven to be a better predictor of whether you will be successful in the role.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What the process will look like for you:</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 - Application: </strong>Answer three questions relating to scenarios you would be likely to face in the role. We aim to get back to you within 3 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2 - Phone call: </strong>If you're among the top-scoring applicants, you'll be invited to a 25-minute phone call with the hiring manager to screen for basic requirements and to find out more about your expectations.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3 - Video interview part 1:</strong> This will usually be a 50-minute video call with the hiring manager and another team member you would work with closely in the role. It will be focussed on the technical skills needed to be successful in the role, and may include a task. You will always be told what to expect in advance. </p>\n<p><strong>Step 4 - Video interview part 2: </strong>The second stage will be 2 x 50-minute video calls with other members of the team. The first will focus on alignment with our approach and philosophy in product &amp; design, and the second will be on qualities and behaviours that show alignment with our company values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are greater than the sum of our parts</li>\n<li>We make a positive difference</li>\n<li>We strive for a better solution</li>\n<li>We embrace change</li>\n<li>We assume best intent</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h4\"><strong><u>What's it like working at Unmade?</u></strong></div>\n<p>We are building a product to have a lasting, positive impact on the fashion and sportswear industries, and the planet.</p>\n<p>We care about the work we do, are passionate about doing it, and are supportive of everyone to do the same.</p>\n<p>We push for the best, but know that even with the best laid plans things can go wrong, and encourage sharing and learning from challenges. </p>\n<p>We value learning from each other and sharing what we do. We foster a culture of collaboration and learning. No one is unapproachable, and everyone's voice matters.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\"><strong><u>Why you'll love working at Unmade</u></strong></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Employee share options:</strong> All employees have the option to buy shares at a later date, at a discounted price with reduced tax liability.</li>\n<li><strong>25 days + bank and public holidays.</strong> You're encouraged to use them and can buy more days if you need.</li>\n<li><strong>Charity days:</strong> 2 days of paid leave to volunteer for an organisation you love each year.</li>\n<li><strong>Equal parental leave: </strong>Up to a year off and enhanced pay for maternity, paternity or adoption, no matter your gender or situation.</li>\n<li><strong>Flexible working hours:</strong> Organise your own time over the week to help you fit work around life.</li>\n<li><strong>Kit:</strong> Freedom to choose your tools (hardware and software).</li>\n<li><strong>Learning and development:</strong> Individual annual budget for courses, events and books to help you learn and grow.</li>\n<li><strong>Annual salary reviews:</strong> In line with a salary framework, to ensure equal pay for equal work and that we recognise and reward when your responsibilities increase.</li>\n<li><strong>Save on travel:</strong> Season travel ticket loans.</li>\n<li><strong>Cycle and tech schemes: </strong>Schemes to help make staying active and connected more affordable.</li>\n<li><strong>Mental health support: </strong>A safe space to talk with monthly mental health coaching from Sanctus.</li>\n<li><strong>Socials: </strong>Virtual activities to help us stay connected and have fun together. Quarterly team trips and away days when we're not in a pandemic!</li>\n<li><strong>Knowledge-sharing: </strong>Weekly team talks and a culture of learning from each other.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We try to communicate as openly as possible across the team, including monthly AMAs with the leadership team.</li>\n<li><strong>Feedback:</strong> We encourage honest feedback and conduct quarterly pulse surveys with the team to better understand how we can improve.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"h4\"><strong><u>Inclusion &amp; Equality</u></strong></div>\n<p>Unmade cares deeply about helping the tech industry become a more inclusive and diverse place and we work hard to lead by example. We are committed to Equal Employment Opportunity and building an environment of belonging for all. We encourage all our team members to bring their whole selves to work, regardless of gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age or disability.</p>\n<div class=\"h4\"><strong><u>Visa sponsorship</u></strong></div>\n<p>We hold a sponsor licence for Skilled Worker visas. Due to current travel restrictions and our need to hire quickly, we can only consider applicants who require visa sponsorship if they are already living in the UK or Ireland, whilst adhering to the provisions of the Equality Act 2010.</p>\n<p><strong>Application close date: Sunday 18th July</strong></p>\n"

Every day we face everyday poor video quality, buffering, long waits for transcoding, and latency on livestreams that prevent so many teams from innovating in how we use video on the internet. This is why <strong>we are building a new global video backbone accessible via an easy-to-use API</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs and developers shouldn't be constrained by their understanding of arcane video codecs and protocols, they shouldn't have to worry about what device their users are using or where they are located in the world.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to enable those entrepreneurs and developers to build wildly innovative video experiences more quickly and easily than ever before.</p>\n<div class=\"h2\"><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Our values:</span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Be bold</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not build the video backbone the web deserves if we stay on our comfort zone and do not consistently raise the bar in everything we do.

We’re looking for a DevOps Manager to lead the infrastructure team that powers our platform. This role can be anywhere in the US.</p>\n<p>We're on a mission to perfect mortgage closings for all. Powering millions of closings a year, Snapdocs is leading the charge to modernize, streamline, and improve the mortgage process for lenders, borrowers, and settlement. Snapdocs brings security, efficiency, and joy to a paper-based pillar of the US economy through integration and automation. The type of problems we focus on involves workflow, product design, and data. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!).</p>\n<p>As a DevOps Manager, you will play a central role leading the DevOps team building our staging &amp; production Kubernetes environments, creating automation, containerization with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, scalability, monitoring, developing best practices for deployments, security &amp; DR to ensure 99.99% AWS uptime. You will be responsible for Site Reliability/ availability of infrastructure. You monitor costs of Infrastructure, ROI, and capacity management. You will collaborate with product and engineering teams to release at a high velocity and ensure developer adoption. Currently, the team is working in AWS, Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Ruby on Rails, React, Postgres, &amp; GO to name a few but things change quickly so be comfortable learning new tools. You will lead a team consisting of 6-8 DevOps and Data engineers total initially with the goal to grow over time. You will drive attraction, growth, and retention of top talent by working closely with the talent team.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you are a great balance between an expert in the DevOps, Cloud world and a manager with empathy. Over the past 8+ years, you have gained expertise in Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS) systems administration. Today, you have moved everything out of the DC into the cloud, deployed containerization strategies using Docker and have mastered AWS services (EC2, VPC, S3, RDS, IAM, ElastiCache, Redshift, Elastic MapReduce, Route 53, CloudFormation, Elastic Beanstalk). You strive to automate everything possible and have worked with server automation tools like Terraform and Kubernetes (Helm). You have an expert level understanding of cloud-native technologies. You have seen scale in your time; solving a diverse range of problems with complex distributed systems &amp; relational databases (PostgreSQL, Redis) in both startups and large organizations. More recently (5+ years or so) you can be found coaching, mentoring, performance monitoring, managing scope, setting vision, making architectural &amp; technical decisions. You lead from within and understand that coaching and mentoring are almost always better than “managing” (but you know how and when to do that too). When issues arise, you are ready to roll up your sleeves to help unblock the team as needed. </p>\n<div class='\"content-conclusion\"'>\n<p>Snapdocs strongly values diversity and drive. We want to work with people of different backgrounds and different paths in life, and we trust our team to make smart decisions. This means we value independent work as well as collaboration.

Our product makes working with cutting-edge open-source technologies more accessible to users and operationalizes them for enterprises. Our customers, who range from household names like Daimler-Benz and Adidas to cloud-native startups, use Lenses to help run their strategic streaming and software applications: think IoT, fraud-detection AI engines, and cutting-edge consumer-facing microservices.</p>\n<p><strong>Looking to make a difference?</strong></p>\n<p>The Lenses.io SRE team is expanding, and you could be our next, new valuable member!</p>\n<p>More often than not, SRE, DevOps, and Ops stand for <em>way too many responsibilities to list on a single page</em>. We are not going to lie, it’s the same for us, and our little shared secret is that we do enjoy our role —and hopefully, the same stands for you because we have a ton of work ahead of us.</p>\n<p>There are three roles currently open:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SRE/Platform</strong> with solid abilities in SaaS and managed services (senior)</li>\n<li><strong>SRE/Platform,</strong> preferably with experience in Apache Kafka (mid/senior)</li>\n<li><strong>SRE/DevOps</strong> (mid/senior)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also welcome junior applicants who are eager to evolve their careers.</p>\n<p>If you are curious, open-minded, hungry, and eager to learn then Lenses.io is the place for you!</p>\n<p>Let’s go over the role descriptions. Note that all our SREs take tasks from both tracks —that’s what we call them, platform and devops—, but the respective track is favored when it comes to architectural tasks or challenging problems.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p><strong>What your day-to-day looks like:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SRE/Platform</strong></p>\n<p>You are focused on providing and supporting services for the company, our clients, and users. Obviously, it has to be fast, secure, scalable, and robust though we keep these descriptions for our presentations.

Although devops is a culture, DevOps engineers are valuable members who accelerate developers by taking charge of the tough challenges for the delivery process like CICD, release automation and packaging.
